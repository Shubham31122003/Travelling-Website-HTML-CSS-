                        Nalanda district in Bihar is one of the prime tourist hotspots in the state. The destination is
                        historically and culturally rich and is home to the ancient Nalanda University, a UNESCO World
                        Heritage Site. The university of Nalanda shot to fame during ancient times and attained
                        legendary status for its contribution to education, culture, and civilization. Set around 95 km
                        from Patna, the capital city of Bihar, the city is visited by a huge number of travelers from
                        across the globe. <br>
                        When it comes to tourist attractions, the destination has built a jungle safari to entice
                        tourists and an adventurous glass bridge is also a part of the nature safari. The stunning view
                        of Ghoda Katora, the ancient Cyclopean wall, Sone Bhandar caves, and many more places will help
                        you enrich yourself.

                        Magine being at the ruins of the world's oldest university? Imagine seeing restored and
                        still-to-be-restored temples and Buddhist monasteries? The place is alive with spiritualism.
                        <br>
                        First time I have seen the ruins of Nalanda University.If ruins are so marvellous then we can
                        imagine the original structure and environment of the university.water management system and
                        grain storage system was available at that time. One big kitchen and furnace was available at
                        that time.Always, one should have a guide, so that, he /she should get the proper and authentic
                        information about the university through ruins.

                            Founded in 427 CE, Nalanda is considered the world's first residential university, a sort of
                            medieval Ivy League institution home to nine million books that attracted 10,000 students
                            from across Eastern and Central Asia. They gathered here to learn medicine, logic,
                            mathematics and – above all – Buddhist principles from some of the era's most revered
                            scholars. As the Dalai Lama once stated: "The source of all the [Buddhist] knowledge we
                            have, has come from Nalanda."

                            Nalanda was an acclaimed Mahavihara, a large Buddhist monastery in the ancient kingdom of
                            Magadha (modern-day Bihar) in India. The site is located about 95 kilometres southeast of
                            Patna near the town of Bihar Sharif, and was a centre of learning from the fifth century CE
                            to1200 CE. It is a UNESCO World Heritage Site.

                            Nalanda is about 16 kilometres (10 mi) north of the city of Rajgir and about 90 kilometres
                            (56 mi) southeast of Patna, connected via NH 31, 20 and 120 to India's highway network.[5]
                            It is about 80 kilometres (50 mi) northeast of Bodh Gaya – another important Buddhist site
                            in Bihar. The Nalanda archaeological site is spread over a large area to the northwest of
                            Bargaon (Nalanda) village, and is between the historical manmade lakes Gidhi, Panashokar and
                            Indrapuskarani. On the south bank of the Indrapushkarani lake is the Nava Nalanda Mahavihara
                            – a university founded in its memory.[20][21]

                            Nalanda University was established to emulate the ancient university of Nalanda, which
                            functioned between the 5th and 13th centuries. The idea to resurrect Nalanda University was
                            endorsed in 2007 at the 2nd East Asia Summit by the sixteen member countries.[5] In 2009,
                            during the 4th East Asia summit, ASEAN member states including Australia, China, Korea,
                            Singapore and Japan promised further support.[6] The State Government of Bihar handed over
                            land acquired from local people, to the university for its new campus.[7][8][9][10][11]
                            Chief Minister of Bihar Nitish Kumar also met External Affairs Minister SM Krishna to
                            receive reassurance that the Central Government would allocate sufficient funds to the
                            project.
